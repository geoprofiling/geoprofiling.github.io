MSF produces an average of 2 million litres per day from the Albert Nile River, which is delivered to tanks throughout the settlement by water trucks rented by UNHCR. Bad road conditions make it difficult for trucks to access the whole camp after heavy rains, leaving several areas vulnerable to water shortage. Access to water is one of the biggest challenges in Rhino settlement. To reach certain areas, water trucks have to drive more than one-and-a-half hours one way, which during the rainy season may be delayed or made entirely impossible. On average in April 2017, the refugee population in Ofua zones received around 4.6 litres per person per day. MSF is working to improve the sustainability of the water delivery system by improving boreholes to bring the water source closer to the settlement. As of May 2017, MSF (OCP and OCA) is working in 4 refugee settlements, Bidi Bidi, Imvepi, Palorinya and Rhino; providing inpatient and outpatient care, maternity care, nutrition programme, and water and sanitation provision.<br/>By 5 May 2017, there were over 901,755 South Sudanese refugees in Uganda, with the number expected to rise to nearly one million by the end of the year. Some 86% of the South Sudanese refugees in Uganda are women and children under 18, and an average 2,000 new refugees arrive each week. Uganda is now the largest hosting country for South Sudanese refugees, and also the country hosting the largest population of refugees in Africa. Photographer: Yuna Cho/MSF"
